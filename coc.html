          <p>Code of Conduct</p>

<h2 id="1purpose">1. Purpose</h2>

<p>A primary goal of indiewebcoursetemplate is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).</p>

<p>This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.</p>

<p>We invite all those who participate in indiewebcoursetemplate to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.</p>

<h2 id="2yourcontrolyourdata">2. Your Control Your Data</h2>

<p>You interact with this class from your own domain where you publish your data. This might be a blogger account, a wix page, or a WordPress blog but this LMS can't collect your data. You have the right to delete your data at any time.</p>

<h2 id="3righttoprivacy">3. Right to Privacy</h2>

<p>While this class is built on and encourages open pedagogy you will never be required to share any task or assignment. You may password protect your blog or website and share the password with just the class or just with me.</p>

<p>While many of us syndicate to social media you are never required to join any network beyond our private chat rooms. If an assignment revolves aroudn social media a transcript or video can be provided to anyone who does not wish to join or interact with social media silos.</p>

<p>At the end of class you may delete your blog and your stream account. I will also remove </p>

<h2 id="4publicprivateandopen">4. Public, Private, and Open</h2>

<p>What does public and "in the open" mean?</p>

<p>Online communication, such as tweets, blog posts, and comments are generally out in the open and technically “public” and available for researchers to analyze and quote. Internet researchers have, however, documented how a particular communication may be technically public but viewed by the individual who posted it as meant for a more limited or private context. </p>

<p>Even if an individual feels that they have “published” in public or have consented to be part of research, they might still feel like trust has been violated if their words are taken up and re-framed in a way that they feel is out of context or misrepresented.</p>

<p>Think about each other when sharing information. Critical feedback helps us grow but keep that to our private stream. Use our public comments on each others blogs to encourage growth of the learner and the community.</p>

<p>If you are a student in my class I will always file for IRB (instutional Review Board)even if you choose to publish much of your data in the open. I will never know if you agreed to be in a study until after grades are submitted.</p>

<p>Even if your data is techically public I will always ask for approval before direct quoting or including any artifact you make in class as part of a study,</p>

<h2 id="5expectedbehavior">5. Expected Behavior</h2>

<p>The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:</p>

<ul>
<li>Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.</li>

<li>Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.</li>

<li>Attempt collaboration before conflict.</li>

<li>Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.</li>

<li>Provide feedback to your peers</li>

<li>Answer questions when you can and help point people in the right direction when you can't</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="6unacceptablebehavior">6. Unacceptable Behavior</h2>

<p>The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:</p>

<ul>
<li>Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.</li>

<li>Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.</li>

<li>Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.</li>

<li>Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information ("doxing").</li>

<li>Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.</li>

<li>Inappropriate photography or recording.</li>

<li>Incessentaly correcting graamer</li>

<li>Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone’s consent before touching them.</li>

<li>Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances.</li>

<li>Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).</li>

<li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.</li>

<li>Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="7consequencesofunacceptablebehavior">7. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior</h2>

<p>Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.</p>

<p>Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.</p>

<p>If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).</p>

<h2 id="7nonotificationpolicy">7. No Notification Policy</h2>

<p>When in class I would never ask you not to have a laptop or cell phone. That contains way more computing power than we took to the moon. I do ask for attention. So do a lot of companies who drill into your brain through notifications.</p>

<p>I ask that when in class you globally turn off notfications. When working online deadicate yourself to class. Shut down any sms notifications, close all social media tabs not related to class, and learn.</p>

<p>Notifications work like drugs. Literally. Brain scientists work for companies and study how to make you click more. Stay attention sober during class.</p>

<h2 id="8nodriving">8. No Driving</h2>

<p>You are expressivley forbidden to compelte any activity or interact with any other person in this class while operating a vehicle. Doing so puts others at risks and thereore falls under unacceptable behavior. Plus its illegal (in Connecticut), so there is that too. </p>

<h2 id="videodata">Video Data</h2>

<p>If this class involves video projects you will never be required to show your face. If you do a group project all group members must consent before a video upload. Any group member has the right of refusal. You can email mcverryj1@southernct.edu if your would like to ask for a video removal without letting your other group members know.</p>

<h2 id="6reportingguidelines">6. Reporting Guidelines</h2>

<p>If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible. jgregmcverry@gmail.com.</p>

<p>[LINK<em>TO</em>REPORTING_GUIDELINES]</p>

<p>Additionally, community organizers are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.</p>

<h2 id="7addressinggrievances">7. Addressing Grievances</h2>

<p>If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify jgregmcverry@gmail.com with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing governing policies.</p>

<p>[LINK<em>TO</em>POLICY]</p>

<h2 id="8scope">8. Scope</h2>

<p>We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues–online and in-person–as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.</p>

<p>This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.</p>
